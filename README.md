# workoutTracker2.0
my failure of a workout tracking python program

Wanted this to be a simple workout tracker. You say what kind of workout day it was, and then you type 1 if you did the
exercise, and 0 if you didn't. If you did the exercise, you type out the weight, the sets, and the reps. All of this would be saved to a 
google sheets. however once I got it to work. I tried to optimize it, and it all crumbled down slowly, to the point that I cannot
salvage it. It is truly a sad day.
